            <h1 id="Madrid">Madrid, Spain</h1>
            <p> I had the luck to be born in Madrid, capital of Spain, a vibrating city where there is always a multicultural mixture of people wandering around its streets. Downtown is always full of life until late in the night, together with its mild weather and affable inhabitants made me fall in love with this city instantly.</p>
            <p> In Madrid I studied Telecommunication Engineering in the Politechnic University of Madrid, one of the top educational institutions in the country. In 2010 I left Spain looking for new experiences. I wanted to become fluent in English and expand my comfort zone, learn about new cultures and new people, I went to America.</p>
            
            <h1 id="Chicago">Chicago, Illinois, United States</h1>
            <p> The second city will be always the first in my heart. Its architecture is as beautiful as it can get, and its deep-dish pizzas are so delicious -and unhealthy- at the same time, leave aside its freezing winters. </p>
            <p> Chicago was the door to my american experience, I moved here in 2010 to start a Master's in Physics, one of my passions, and what I thought would be a one year trip became my home.
            A year later I found myself very comfortable and I had the chance to pursue a PhD. in Experimental Particle Physics at Illinois Institute of Technology. </p>
            <p> In the meantime I could enjoy watching the NBA in live for first time, flying a small plane on top of Navy Pier or sailing the Michigan Lake. </p>
            
            <h1 id="Beijing">Beijing,China</h1>
            <p> In 2014 I was granted the Pengnian scholarship and I spent a semester as a visiting researcher at Tsinghua University (清华大学).</p>
	    <p> In that time I had the chance to be immersed in a culture like no other, I could learn about Chinese arts, food, architecture, language and most importantly its people. </p>
            <p> Being in such a different environment makes you realize that travelling and being far from home can be hard at times, but the unforgettable experiences you get in return are the best reward, so I will keep doing it as long as possible.</p>
            
	    <h1 id="Cambridge">Cambridge, Massachussetts, United States</h1>
            <p> In my last year of PhD. I moved to Cambridge, a fantastic little town near Boston that is home of two of the most renowned universities in the world,i.e., Harvard and <abbr title="Massachussetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr>.</p>
            <p> This makes Cambridge a very intelectual challenging environment, where I would like to stay for a few more years. Right now I am looking forward to find a job or research position in the neighborhood.</p>
	    <p> If you know about a position that could fit my profile, <a href="Contact.html">let me know!</a></p>

            <h1 id="Herrera">Herrera de Alc&aacute;ntara, Spain</h1>
            <p> Enjoying this little town nearby Portugal is the best way to rest from the frenetic city life and find yourself back in the old traditions, natural food and clean starry skies.</p>
            <p> It is not by chance that in summer its population doubles when the expatriates come back to their roots. No matter the distance, I will always return to its peaceful roads and gorgeous sightseeings. </p>
